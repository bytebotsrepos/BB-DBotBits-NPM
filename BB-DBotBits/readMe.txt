BB-DBotBits Library

Please note this is early beta

Your fastest route to creating Discord bots with minimal effort. Our library is designed to cater to developers at all skill levels, from beginners building their first bot to experienced users seeking to streamline their development process.

About:
The ByteBots Library simplifies the process of Discord bot development by offering pre-built functions and modules, making it easy to create bots that range from basic to advanced. Our tools are designed to help you get up and running quickly, focusing on your bot's unique features instead of spending time on repetitive setups.

Features:
- Simple and Intuitive: Built with ease of use in mind. No complex configurations.
- Fast Development: Focus on your bot's features, not the boilerplate. Get up and running quickly.

NOTE:
You will need to make a token.env file inside the token.env you need to add this:
token=yourToken
Replace your token with your token.

And edit settings inside settings folder.

Documentation:
For detailed documentation, setup instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips, visit our website: bytebots.net

Note: Depending on the number of building blocks in your bot, it may take up to 5 minutes to register all commands. If commands do not appear after a few minutes, simply restart Discord.
